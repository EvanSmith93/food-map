          the nuts are dry crack them by using a large flat rock placed in a
          flat basket lined temporarily with a cloth, use a smaller rock to
          pound the nuts when placed on the larger rock. When the nuts are all
          cracked sieve them through a sieve basket. Place the kernels and small
          hulls that passed through the sieve in the corn beater and pound until
          the substance can be made into balls. Roll this into balls until ready
          for use. These balls will keep fresh for several days if the weather
          is not too warm. When ready for Hickory Nut Soup place a ball or more
          in a vessel that will hold water, pour boiling water over the balls
          while stirring constantly. If this is made into a thick soup it may be
          served with any type bread or dumpling. If it is made into a thin soup
          it may be used as a drink. As soon as enough soup has been poured off
          to leave a very thick mixture more water may be added. Do not drink
          the very last of the mixture because that is where the little bits of
          hulls are.`,
