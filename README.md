# Food Globalization Map

This is a website I built as a semester project for a BYU history class. It's purpose is to educate people about foods from various cultures and how food has, and still does, evolve as cultures mix and become more globalized.

It's built on React and TypeScript. It uses Leaflet JS for the interactive map and the OpenAI API for generating unique recipes. You can view the site [here](https://food-map-psi.vercel.app/).
